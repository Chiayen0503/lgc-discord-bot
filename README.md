# Discord bot for the Lancaster Co Club

Go to the Lancaster Go Club Discord channel [here](https://discord.gg/6FqNWpZ).

Current commands:

```
!badproverb -- Gives you a random proverb to... er... 
!sensei [term-no-spaces] -- Displays the first paragraph for a specified term from Sensei's Library
```

Heavily inspired by the [Open Study Room Discord bot](https://github.com/climu/OSR-discord-bot) whose code provided an initial template for this bot.
